# Trivia üß©

## Project Context üí°

Quiz game based on the trivia game style, where the user can:
- Log in to the game and, if their email is registered on the Gravatar website, have your photo associated with the user's profile;
- Access the page referring to the game, where you must choose one of the available answers before the time goes out or the answer is considered wrong;
- Be redirected after 5 answered questions to the score screen, where the text shown depends on the number of correct answers;
- View the ranking page, if you like, at the end of each game.

The functionalities of this project were developed by a group of 5 people, according to the demands defined in a kanban board, using pair programming when necessary. We held daily meetings to keep tabs on what was being done until that moment.
